# secure-developer-utilities
A set of utilities to aid developers in a local environment with JVM support

### Why a new software when there are so many online utilities available?

Below are some reasons
- Company policy requires only use of in-house softwares
- Access to online tools disabled by the organization's firewall
- Sensitive or protected data should not be put online for things such as tranformations, validating, minifying etc
- Industry-specific regulations 
and so on...
